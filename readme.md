# Online Time Series Forecasting App with Prophet

This Streamlit app allows users to upload time series data, perform forecasting using Facebook's Prophet, and visualize the results, all through a web interface.

## App Link

[Access the Time Series Forecasting App](https://your-app-link-here.com)

## Features

- Upload CSV files containing time series data
- Adjust model parameters via an interactive sidebar
- Visualize forecasts and component breakdowns
- Perform cross-validation (for datasets with sufficient data)
- Calculate and display forecast accuracy metrics
- Download the combined original data and forecast results

## Usage

1. Navigate to the app using the link above.

2. Upload a CSV file containing your time series data. The file should have two columns:
   - 'ds': Date column (in a format recognizable by pandas, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD)
   - 'y': Target variable (numeric values)

3. Use the sidebar to adjust model parameters:
   - Changepoint Prior Scale
   - Seasonality Prior Scale
   - Holidays Prior Scale
   - Forecast Period (in days)

4. View the results:
   - Forecast plot
   - Forecast components breakdown
   - Cross-validation metrics (if applicable)
   - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
   - Combined data and forecast table

5. Download the full data and forecast as a CSV file using the provided button.

## Data Privacy

This app processes data in the browser and does not store any uploaded data. Your data is used solely for generating the forecast and is not retained after you close the app.

## Limitations

- The app is designed to handle reasonably sized datasets. Very large files may result in slower processing times.
- The forecast quality depends on the nature and quality of the uploaded data.
- The app uses a predefined set of holidays for the US market. If your data is from a different region, you may need to adjust for this.
